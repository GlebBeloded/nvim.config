## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Queue picker prints one JSON document
`.archon/scripts/queue_pick.py` SHALL write exactly one JSON document to stdout in every case (with or without `INPUTS_CHANGE`, whether or not any `loop/<change>` branch exists, found or not found), so `make queue` without `CHANGE` can always read the picked change.

#### Scenario: Queue skips a taken change
- **WHEN** `make queue` is run without `CHANGE` (via `vim.system`) in a repo on `auto` whose stub `openspec list --json` lists two changes, the older of which already has a `loop/<change>` branch, with `ARCHON` set to a stub that logs its `workflow run` arguments
- **THEN** make exits 0, its output contains `Working on <newer change>` and no `JSONDecodeError`, and the stub was called with `--branch loop/<newer change>`, while `python3 .archon/scripts/queue_pick.py` run in the same repo prints a stdout that `vim.json.decode` parses as one object with `change` equal to the newer change
