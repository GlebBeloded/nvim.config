# Spec Delta

## Purpose

The local AI loop's make targets (`make fix`, `feature`, `queue`, `update`): each runs one Archon workflow on a `loop/*` branch cut from `auto` and tidies up after it.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Shipped run is cleaned up
After its Archon workflow returns, each loop target SHALL run the merged cleanup against a `local/auto` that includes every merge into `auto` made during the run, so the worktree and `loop/*` branch of a run that shipped are removed.

#### Scenario: Cleanup sees the merge the run shipped
- **WHEN** `make fix BUG=x` (and likewise `feature`, `queue`, `update`) is run in a repo with the self-remote `local`, `ARCHON` set to a stub whose `workflow run` merges the run branch into `auto` with `--no-ff`
- **THEN** when the stub is called with `isolation cleanup --merged`, `local/auto` equals `auto` and `git branch --merged local/auto` lists the run's `loop/*` branch
