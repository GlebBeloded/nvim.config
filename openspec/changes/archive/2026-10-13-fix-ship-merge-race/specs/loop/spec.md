## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Ship merges into auto one at a time and never leaves it mid-merge
`.archon/scripts/ship.py` SHALL merge into the `auto` checkout only while it holds a host-side lock: a pid file in the repo's common git dir. A lock whose pid is no longer alive SHALL be taken over, and the lock SHALL be released on every exit. After any failed merge, ship SHALL leave `auto` at its pre-merge commit with no `MERGE_HEAD` and no staged or modified tracked files.

#### Scenario: Concurrent ships merge one at a time
- **WHEN** `python3 .archon/scripts/ship.py` is started via `vim.system`, all at once, in four worktrees of a throwaway repo whose main checkout is on `auto`, each worktree on a `loop/*` branch with one commit that does not conflict with the others
- **THEN** all four exit 0, `git log --first-parent auto` shows four new merges (one per branch), the `auto` checkout has no `MERGE_HEAD`, `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no` there is empty, and no ship lock file remains

#### Scenario: Stale ship lock is taken over
- **WHEN** the ship lock file already exists and holds the pid of a process that has exited, and `ship.py` is run via `vim.system` in a worktree on a `loop/*` branch with one commit
- **THEN** ship exits 0 within its timeout, `auto` contains the merge of that branch, and no ship lock file remains

#### Scenario: Failed merge leaves auto clean
- **WHEN** `ship.py` is run via `vim.system` in a worktree on a `loop/*` branch with one commit, and the repo has a `pre-merge-commit` hook that exits 1, which stops the merge after it is staged
- **THEN** ship exits non-zero, `auto` still points at its pre-merge commit, the `auto` checkout has no `MERGE_HEAD` and `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no` there is empty, the `loop/*` branch still exists, and no ship lock file remains

### Requirement: Ship reports a conflict for reconcile
When the merge into `auto` conflicts and the input `on_conflict` is `report`, `ship.py` SHALL leave `auto` untouched, exit 0 and print a JSON result with `merged` false, `conflict` true and the conflicting files, so the deliver workflow can reconcile the run branch and re-run the gate.

#### Scenario: Conflicting ship is reported for reconcile
- **WHEN** `ship.py` is run via `vim.system` with `INPUTS_ON_CONFLICT=report` in a worktree whose `loop/*` branch changes the same line of a file that `auto` has also changed since the branch was cut
- **THEN** ship exits 0 and prints one JSON object with `merged` false, `conflict` true and `files` listing that file; `auto` is unchanged, the `auto` checkout has no `MERGE_HEAD` and no staged or modified tracked files, and no ship lock file remains
